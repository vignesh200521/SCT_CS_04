# ⌨️ Keyboard Event Tracker (Educational Demo)

This project demonstrates how to use the [`pynput`](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library in Python to capture keyboard events.  
It records typed input and saves it to a file, showing how to handle normal characters, special keys (space, enter, backspace), and event listeners.
